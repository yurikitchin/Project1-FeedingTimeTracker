# Project1-FeedingTimeTracker
Group project Feeding time Tracker
The feeding time tracker is a web app that helps mothers manage breast feeding their children. It allows them to easily know which breast they should next feed their child on. Mothers that exclusively breastfeed their children face the task of manually tracking which breast they should next feed their child on. Alternating the breast a baby is fed on may seem a trivial detail however the health benefits of doing so are profound. Besides helping to build up a healthy supply of breast milk, alternating breasts can help a baby nurse longer, provide more breast milk at each feeding to a newborn who needs to gain weight, and even helps to prevent serious disease like mastitis.
